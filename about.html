            <h2>What is green energy?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Green energy refers to electricity generated from renewable sources like sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, green energy sources are abundant, sustainable, and produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions during power generation. Harnessing green energy is vital for reducing our reliance on finite resources and combating climate change.</p>

            <h2>How do I change to green energy?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Transitioning to green energy involves various steps, starting with energy conservation and efficiency measures to reduce overall consumption. Individuals can then switch to renewable energy sources by installing solar panels, utilizing wind turbines, or opting for green energy plans offered by utility providers. Additionally, supporting policies and initiatives that promote clean energy development and investing in renewable energy technologies can accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future.</p>
