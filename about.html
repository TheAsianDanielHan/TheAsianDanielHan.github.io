		<h1 class="title">ABOUT</h1>
		<p class="word">The Hobbit is a book about Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who loves nothing more than comforting things and cozy things. He is forced into a world of adventure by an old wizard named Gandalf, and joins forces with thirteen dwarves. They are led by Thorin, who is the heir of the Lonely Mountain, and their quest is to take back the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, the evil dragon. They encounter various other beings from different places, such as Beorn, who can turn into a bear, and the human inhabitants of Lake Town. Bilbo is the Burglar, meant to sneak in and out of places, scout around, and take back evidence of his account. This book started off very dull and remained mostly dull until the end. I hope you enjoy.</p>

		<p class="word">J. R. R. Tolkien, or John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, specialised in Old and Middle English. He was an author, professor, critic, and once a military officer in WWI. He is most known for his books about a past earth, named Middle Earth, which was populated with fictitious goblins, dwarves, wizards, humans, and hobbits, among many others.

Tolkien was born in South Africa in January 1982. His parents were Arthur Tolkien and Mabel Suffield Tolkien. He moved to Birmingham with his mother and brother, Hilary, at age fifteen when his father passed away. In 1904, Mabel Tolkien died and the brothers were sent to boarding homes. He went to Exeter College, and received degrees on Germanic and Anglo-Saxon language, as well as classic literature.

He enlisted during World War I, as a second lieutenant. He served until 1916, when he was hospitalised due to trench fever. During this time he also married Edith Bratt in 1916. It was during this time that “Middle Earth” was first created. After recovering, he became a professor at Oxford, he started a writing group, which he named “the inklings.” Included in this group included other famous writers such as C.S. Lewis, author of the Chronicles of Narnia, Roger Lancelyn Green, who adapted the Adventures of Robin Hood and the Knights of the Round Table, and Owen Bartfield.

Tolkien’s first major success was published in 1937, and was called “The Hobbit,” which was about a small human-like creature, also known as a hobbit, named Bilbo Baggins and all his adventures. He also drew over 100 sketches to go along with the story. However, Tolkien’s largest success is another book series, “The Lord of The Rings.” This series also took place in Middle Earth, and is inspired by ancient myths, with an extensive lore. He created custom maps and languages for this series, and released the first book, “The fellowship of the Ring,” in 1954. The later two installments, “The two towers” and “The Return of the King” were both published in 1955.

J. R. R. Tolkien passed away on September 2, 1973. He was 81. Before he died, he had released a collection of poems and essays, called “Tree and Leaf.”
