		<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 1:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">An Unexpected Party</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">The Narrator, an third-party perspective with a limited viewpoint, starts off by explaining what Hobbits are. Hobbits are creatures that are about half of a human’s height, have thick hair on their feet, round stomachs, and love good food and a comfortable atmosphere. The Hobbit of the story, Bilbo Baggins, lives in a Hobbit Hole, a comfy hold in the ground fashioned with round tunnels and pleasant rooms, called Big End. Bilbo has such a nice house because of his parents, who were both from fairly noble families in the Hobbit Society. His father, a Baggins, was from a family known for being true Hobbits: loving comfort. His mother, however, was a Took. Tooks were Hobbits who had exploring and adventure running in their veins. 

		One day, Bilbo is outside on the porch, smoking his pipe, when an old wizard, Gandalf, walks in front of his hobbit hole. They have a lovely conversation about “good morning” and adventures, and while leaving to go inside, Bilbo gets flustered and invites Gandalf to dinner later, without wanting to or meaning to. When it becomes time for said dinner, Bilbo hears a knock on the door. He, expecting Gandalf, opens it, only to find a dwarf there, named Dwalin, who pushes past him, and gets ready to eat. More and more dwarves arrive, until it becomes clear that Gandalf had volunteered Bilbo to be a “burglar”, and Bilbo protests. The dwarves start grumbling that a soft little Hobbit had no place on such an adventure. Gandalf insists that Bilbo would be useful, and Bilbo, suddenly feeling Tookish, states he would like to go in a rush of adrenaline. The leader, Thorin explains that a dragon named Smaug had taken over their old mountain, where his grandfather, Thror, had mined it out for riches. He wanted Bilbo to help retrieve it.

		<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 2:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Roast Mutton</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">Bilbo wakes up late and finds out that the dwarves have left without him. He thinks he is safe from the adventure, but Gandalf basically forces him out of the house, to meet up with the dwarves again at Green Dragon Inn, located in Bywater. Gandalf disappears sometime during the day and the dwarves and bilbo are tired and hungry.

		They meet trolls, and Bilbo is discovered. While they are fighting about how to question him, the dwarves try to save him, then all get captured as well. Eventually, Gandalf comes and pretends to speak as one of the trolls, and forces them to argue into daybreak, where they turn into stone, because trolls cannot stay up past the sunrise. They find old swords which they decide to take with them.

		<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 3:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">A Short Rest</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">They are travelling the Misty Mountains, and Bilbo and co are invited by elves to stay and rest for a while. While there, they meet Elrond, the great chief elf. He can read the old runic language written on the map, and tells them that the swords they found were legendary goblin killer swords.

		The group is very happy when they depart from Rivendell.

		<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 4:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Over Hill and Under Hill</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">In chapter four, Bilbo and company are travelling the Misty Mountains, and they are able to find a good road due to Elrond’s advice. Then, a thunderstorm appears and the group is forced to take up shelter in one of the caves. They find a good cave and settle down. During the night, Bilbo wakes to see that a crack has opened in the cave and the ponies they were riding on were taken away. There were goblins, and they took the entire group down into a chamber. They discover the goblin killer sword, and the goblins become angry. Then a sword kills the great goblin and a voice leads the group up away, and the voice belongs to gandalf. Bilbo trips and smashes his head on the floor, losing consciousness.

		<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 5:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Riddles in the Dark</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">Bilbo wakes up to darkness, and he cannot find anything. He tries to move a little but then gives up and sits down. He picked up a small ring and finds that his pipe was not broken, but he had no lighter or matches. He then decides to carry on and tries to follow a path that the dwarves had gone. Then, he meets a strange creature named Gollum. Gollum goes up to Bilbo, who pulls out the dagger he had got from the trolls, and that the goblins hadn’t found because it was in his pants. Gollum is hungry and wants to eat Bilbo, so he proposes a game about riddles. Bilbo wins the game by asking Gollum what was in his pocket, and since Gollum doesn’t know, he loses. Gollum goes to the middle of the lake to receive his “precious” ring that turns the wearer invisible, but Bilbo had picked it up earlier. When Gollum can’t find it, he thinks Bilbo had stole it which, technically, was true. He runs at Bilbo who slips on the ring and becomes invisible at the right time. Gollum thinks Bilbo went into the exit already, so he unknowingly leads Bilbo to the exit. He stops because there are goblins there, and Bilbo slips past and through the Goblins.
