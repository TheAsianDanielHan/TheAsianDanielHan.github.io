		<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 1:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">An Unexpected Party</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">The Narrator, an third-party perspective with a limited viewpoint, starts off by explaining what Hobbits are. Hobbits are creatures that are about half of a human’s height, have thick hair on their feet, round stomachs, and love good food and a comfortable atmosphere. The Hobbit of the story, Bilbo Baggins, lives in a Hobbit Hole, a comfy hold in the ground fashioned with round tunnels and pleasant rooms, called Big End. Bilbo has such a nice house because of his parents, who were both from fairly noble families in the Hobbit Society. His father, a Baggins, was from a family known for being true Hobbits: loving comfort. His mother, however, was a Took. Tooks were Hobbits who had exploring and adventure running in their veins. 

		One day, Bilbo is outside on the porch, smoking his pipe, when an old wizard, Gandalf, walks in front of his hobbit hole. They have a lovely conversation about “good morning” and adventures, and while leaving to go inside, Bilbo gets flustered and invites Gandalf to dinner later, without wanting to or meaning to. When it becomes time for said dinner, Bilbo hears a knock on the door. He, expecting Gandalf, opens it, only to find a dwarf there, named Dwalin, who pushes past him, and gets ready to eat. More and more dwarves arrive, until it becomes clear that Gandalf had volunteered Bilbo to be a “burglar”, and Bilbo protests. The dwarves start grumbling that a soft little Hobbit had no place on such an adventure. Gandalf insists that Bilbo would be useful, and Bilbo, suddenly feeling Tookish, states he would like to go in a rush of adrenaline. The leader, Thorin explains that a dragon named Smaug had taken over their old mountain, where his grandfather, Thror, had mined it out for riches. He wanted Bilbo to help retrieve it.

		<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 2:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Roast Mutton</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">Bilbo wakes up late and finds out that the dwarves have left without him. He thinks he is safe from the adventure, but Gandalf basically forces him out of the house, to meet up with the dwarves again at Green Dragon Inn, located in Bywater. Gandalf disappears sometime during the day and the dwarves and bilbo are tired and hungry.

		They meet trolls, and Bilbo is discovered. While they are fighting about how to question him, the dwarves try to save him, then all get captured as well. Eventually, Gandalf comes and pretends to speak as one of the trolls, and forces them to argue into daybreak, where they turn into stone, because trolls cannot stay up past the sunrise. They find old swords which they decide to take with them.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 3:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">A Short Rest</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">They are travelling the Misty Mountains, and Bilbo and co are invited by elves to stay and rest for a while. While there, they meet Elrond, the great chief elf. He can read the old runic language written on the map, and tells them that the swords they found were legendary goblin killer swords.

		The group is very happy when they depart from Rivendell.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 4:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Over Hill and Under Hill</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">In chapter four, Bilbo and company are travelling the Misty Mountains, and they are able to find a good road due to Elrond’s advice. Then, a thunderstorm appears and the group is forced to take up shelter in one of the caves. They find a good cave and settle down. During the night, Bilbo wakes to see that a crack has opened in the cave and the ponies they were riding on were taken away. There were goblins, and they took the entire group down into a chamber. They discover the goblin killer sword, and the goblins become angry. Then a sword kills the great goblin and a voice leads the group up away, and the voice belongs to gandalf. Bilbo trips and smashes his head on the floor, losing consciousness.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">CHAPTER 5:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Riddles in the Dark</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">Bilbo wakes up to darkness, and he cannot find anything. He tries to move a little but then gives up and sits down. He picked up a small ring and finds that his pipe was not broken, but he had no lighter or matches. He then decides to carry on and tries to follow a path that the dwarves had gone. Then, he meets a strange creature named Gollum. Gollum goes up to Bilbo, who pulls out the dagger he had got from the trolls, and that the goblins hadn’t found because it was in his pants. Gollum is hungry and wants to eat Bilbo, so he proposes a game about riddles. Bilbo wins the game by asking Gollum what was in his pocket, and since Gollum doesn’t know, he loses. Gollum goes to the middle of the lake to receive his “precious” ring that turns the wearer invisible, but Bilbo had picked it up earlier. When Gollum can’t find it, he thinks Bilbo had stole it which, technically, was true. He runs at Bilbo who slips on the ring and becomes invisible at the right time. Gollum thinks Bilbo went into the exit already, so he unknowingly leads Bilbo to the exit. He stops because there are goblins there, and Bilbo slips past and through the Goblins.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">Chapter 6:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">Bilbo runs away wearing the invisible ring, and eventually finds the rest of the company. At the time, Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves, who were saying Bilbo was more a bother than a help, and Gandalf was trying to convince them that Bilbo was more useful than they thought. Bilbo takes off the ring and surprises them, and tells them about everything except for the invisibility ring. They start moving, but then wolf-like creatures known as wargs try and kill them. Wargs are allies of goblins, and the group climbs up trees to escape the Wargs. As Gandalf is preparing to jump down and try and kill as many as he can, some eagles come down and bring them to safety, with the Lord of the Eagles escorting Gandalf personally.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">Chapter 7:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Queer Lodgings</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">Gandalf tells the group that he has to leave and they will be on their own. They try and convince him to stay, but he will not be convinced. They go on their way to someone who Gandalf knows, named Beorn. Gandalf tells the dwarves and Bilbo that Beorn might be able to turn into a grizzly bear, lives on wild honey and treats animals with respect. When they arrive, Gandalf tells the dwarves to come in groups of two every five minutes. He and Bilbo go up and meet Beorn, and start recounting their story. Gandalf mentions each time that they are part of a bigger company, and with the constant interruptions in the story, Beorn is getting invested in the story and is more willing to let the dwarves in too. They eat and rest until they are ready to continue their quest.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">Chapter 8:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Flies and Spiders</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">The group, minus Gandalf, enter the dark forest of Mirkwood. There are eyes that stare at them, eyes that belong to insects. After travelling through the forest for days, they come across a river, one that Beorn had warned them about. Beorn had told them not to touch the water, so they found a boat that was moored on the other side, pulled it over, and used it to row across. One Dwarf, Bombur, falls in the water and falls asleep. The rest of the party are forced to carry him. During the night, they see lights through the woods. Ignoring Gandalf and Beorn, they try to follow it, and all get separated. Bilbo is tired and leans against a tree to sleep. When he woke up, a spider had tied him up and was advancing towards him. He takes out his sword and cuts the webs, then kills the spider. He names the sword sting and goes to find the rest of the group. Bilbo, under the invisible ring, leads spiders away from the dwarves by throwing rocks, and freeing the dwarves. They try and fight the spiders off but they cannot. Just as they are about to lose, the spiders retreat. They were in a Wood Elf clearing, and Thorin had been taken. When Thorin doesn’t tell the elves where they are going, they put him in the dungeon, but are not cruel or mean.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">Chapter 9:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Barrels out of Bond</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">The rest of the dwarves also refuse to give away the information, so they are also imprisoned. Bilbo, invisible, talks to the dwarves about escaping. There is a river under the elves’ dwelling, and there are a lot of barrels there. When the guard is sleeping, Bilbo steals the keys and frees the dwarves. They all go down the river in barrels, towards “Lake Town”
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">Chapter 10:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">A Warm Welcome</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">The Barrels float through the river, out of the forest, to Lake Town. Bilbo sees Lonely Mountain, which is where the group needs to go. Lake Town is a human town. When they land, Thorin marches up to the Master of Lake Town, and proudly proclaims that he, a descendant of the King under the Mountain, has returned to retake the Mountain. The town, who have heard stories of how gold would flow down the river when the King was there, give them a lot of gear and welcome them like royalty.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">Chapter 11:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">On the Doorstep</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">The land around the base of the mountain is black and charred because Smaug had burned it all away. They explore the main entrance, and see that it is too dangerous. They decide to try to enter from the secret entrance that they had seen on the map. After a long time of searching, Bilbo finds the passage. The dwarves forgot what Elrond had said the message was, so they tried to use pickaxes to force their way through. It does not work. As the sun is setting, Bilbo remembers the riddle, and when the sun sets a small keyhole opens, allowing Thorin to insert a key and open the door.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">Chapter 12:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Inside Information</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">The dark passage opens up, allowing entrance into the mountain. Thorin tells Bilbo to go scout, as the official Burglar. Bilbo puts on his ring to make himself invisible, and sneaks inside. He sees the dragon, Smaug, asleep on a pile of gold, so Bilbo takes one single gold cup, and rushes back to the dwarves. The dragon wakes up and accounts for all his treasure, finding out that the cup was missing. The dragon flies around breathing fire, sees the ponies, and eats them. Smaug returns and goes back to sleep. Bilbo eventually goes back, but the dragon was faking being asleep, waiting for Bilbo. Smaug can’t see Bilbo, but can smell him, so Smaug senses his presence and starts talking to the invisible Bilbo. Bilbo responds with names that wouldn’t make sense to the dragon, because Smaug didn’t know about Bilbo’s adventures. Bilbo used names like “barrel-rider” or “friend of the bears” to describe himself. Smaug tells Bilbo that he known Bilbo is travelling with dwarves, and that they are a party of fourteen. Bilbo goads the dragon by complimenting Smaug’s power to eventually show his underbelly. Bilbo had seen that the dragon’s underbelly could potentially be a weak spot, and Smaug tries to play it off. Bilbo acts like he sees how strong it is and tries to retreat with the new information. Smaug chases Bilbo and breathes fire at Bilbo, but Bilbo just manages to run away.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">Chapter 13:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Not at Home</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">Smaug knows that the group likely got help from Lake Town, so he flies off there to get his vengeance on it. Smaug leaves the mountain, and while the dwarves are all getting scared and afraid, Thorin stating that he would rather die to Smaug than die in their hidey-hole, Bilbo starts speaking. Bilbo says that he will go back to the dragon room, and encourages the dwarves to come too. They sneak down, looking for traces of Smaug, and eventually discover Smaug had left. Bilbo brings out a torch to explore a treasure room ahead of the dwarves, and finds the arkenstone. Bilbo’s torch goes out and the dwarves have to come out and give him new light.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chapter">Chapter 14:</p>
		<p class="chaptername">Fire and Water</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">Smaug attacks Lake Town. The inhabitants first thought that the golden flames were actual gold flowing down the mountain like in the stories. The dragon starts killing and destroying the Town, when a bowman named Bard starts shooting at Smaug. Bard uses his last arrow, the black arrow, to kill Smaug by shooting his underbelly, and saving the town. The humans and Elves march to the mountain to see if they can steal the gold for themselves.

		<p class="chaptersummary">A bird had been listening to the commotion. The bird was a thrush, and told the raven about what happened. The raven found Bilbo and the dwarves and told them what happened. The party first rejoices at Smaug’s death, then becomes sober at the news of the approaching army. Thorin thinks of the treasure as his heirloom, and plans to fight for it. The army asks for some gold to rebuild, but thorin refuses. Bilbo gets sad because he wants to share the gold to prevent conflict, and because the town was destroyed because of them.

		<p class="chapter">Lake Town</p>
		<p class="chaptersummary">	Lake town, or Esgaroth, was a small trading city south of Lonely Mountain. It is home to humans, and is also known as “Esgaroth upon the Long Lake. The people who live there are humans who spoke in Westron, which is the equivalent of Old English for our world. They also, however, spoke an old dialect of it which was related to the ancient language of Rohirrim. In The Hobbit, Tolkien “translates” Westron to Old English, and this ancient language of Rohirrim to Ancient Norse.
	
	In The Hobbit (which takes place in the third age), Bilbo, Thorin, and the rest of the dwarves travel to Lake Town in barrels by flowing downstream in a river. This river is used by the inhabitants of Lake Town and the Wood Elves to trade, and was Lake Town’s main source of income. Lake Town had once also traded with the dwarves of Lonely Mountain, before the evil dragon, Smaug, had overrun the mountain and chased the dwarves out. At the time, the inhabitants of Lake town welcomed the party with open arms, having heard of stories from their ancestors of how gold would flow down the mountain when the dwarves lived there.

	In the sketches of Lake Town drawn by J. R. R. Tolkien, Lake Town is depicted as wooden homes built on the lake bed, supported by pillars. It follows an architectural style of Eastern Turkish homes. The town was inspired by the early Kievan Rus town of Novgorod, which was also a trade city built on a lake.

	In the third age, the town was attacked by Smaug the Dragon, who had taken shelter in Lonely Mountain after chasing the Dwarves out. Bard the Bowman slew the dragon after exploiting a weakness that Bilbo had seen. The Town was eventually rebuilt with some of the gold that Smaug had hidden, although some of it was stolen by the master of the town. While a lot of people were killed by Smaug, the survivors either helped rebuild the town or followed Bard to make a new one.

	Not much is known about the history of Lake Town after that, although they did eventually join the Kingdom of Dale. Most information about the town came from the third age adventures of Bilbo Baggins or the dwarves
