            <h2>Federal Tax Benefits</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The United States Government has introduced a federal tax credit aimed at reducing inflation and promoting renewable energy. Known as the Residential Clean Energy Credit, this initiative offers a 30% rebate on the installation of various renewable energy systems, including solar, wind, and geothermal energy generators, solar water heaters, fuel cells, and battery storage. This rebate immediately reduces the cost of implementing these systems on your property, thereby lowering taxable income. Additionally, any unused portion of the credit can be carried over to the following year. Furthermore, there are tax credits available for electric vehicles, with incentives of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and $4,000 for used ones. Additionally, homeowners can benefit from a $1,000 tax credit for the installation of home EV chargers, covering up to 30% of the charger's cost.</p>

            <h2>State Tax Benefits</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Many states have implemented a policy known as net metering, which enables homeowners with solar power systems to redeem excess energy generated back to the grid. This surplus electricity is credited towards future energy bills, effectively reducing the cost of electricity consumption for your household. By harnessing solar power, you not only contribute clean energy to the grid but also benefit from savings on your utility bills. Net metering serves as a practical solution for homeowners seeking to offset energy costs while promoting sustainability in their communities.</p>
